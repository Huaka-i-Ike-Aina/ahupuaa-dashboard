This abuliton has always been considered rare with  widely scattered populations. The grazing and antler rubbing activities  of Axis deer or chital (Axis axis), introduced to the islands in  1867, has only added to the abutilon's decline. In 1951, only two or  three plants were found. By the early 1980's this species was considered  extinct. However, in 1987 about 60-70 plants were discovered in the  north fork of Kaheʻa Gulch on a slope. But by 1990, only 30 plants were  observed by Steve Perlman (National Tropical Botanical Garden, Kauaʻi). By June  1993 the population was reduced to only seven specimens--the rest eaten  by deer. [1,2] Today, about 100 plants are found in a single wild population in Kaheʻa Gulch. Fortunately, these plants are in cultivation today and grow in several public and private gardens.","Abutilon eremitopetalum is closely related to koʻoloa ʻula (A. menziesii) and will readily hybridize producing an interesting cross with characteristics of both parents. Like so many other species in the Malvaceae, or Mallow Group, this species, while still uncommon in commercial landscapes, it is rather easy to grow and maintain in the home garden.","[1] ""Recovery Plan for the Lanai Plant Cluster,"" page 26.

[16] Though koa can grow at lower elevations, some varieties may succumb to diseases after a decade of growth.  Since there is so much variety in koa habit from shrubby, multi-branched forms to tall straight trees, it is good to inquire of the source so as to suit your landscaping needs. While koa can grow to heights of over 100 feet in their natural  undisturbed environment, it would take many decades, if ever, to reach  such heights in the urban landscape. They are more likely to grow to  about 20 to 30 feet in the landscape at low elevations. [Rick Barboza,  Hui Kū Maoli Ola] Growth is in virtue of symbiosis with special bacteria called rhizobia that live associated with the roots.  The bacteria convert, or fix, nitrogen from the air into usable nitrogen fertilizer for plants. The leaves, flowers and branches also provide nitrogen for understory and plants in the area. Koa inoculated with rhizobia tend to be more vigorous trees. [1] Recommended planting is above 2000 feet [610 m]. [16] Koa are easily damaged by lawnmowers and gas trimmers, a.k.a. ""weed wackers.""

A serious pest attacking koa in lower elevation is the black twig borer (Xylosandrus compactus, Xyloborus spp.). Periodic pruning and removal of infected twigs is a best management program for this pest. [16,22] The Acacia psyllid (Acizzia uncatoides) can greatly infest koa plantations resulting in branchy, poorly formed trees. [22] Since koa forms a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in the roots for the nitrogen-fixing process, it is recommended that pesticides not be used around the root area. Several fungi (Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Calonectria spp.), root rot (Armillaria spp. Pythium sp.), and rusts (Ateloclauda spp., Endoraecium spp.) on phyllodes are known infect koa. Native rusts (e.g., Ateloclauda digitata) may cause deformation and ""witches broom"" but are not fatal. Older trees are also attacked by a number of wood-rotting fungi.

Fortunately, outbreaks of the koa moth rarely occur."" He says that ""damaged or multiple leaders or malformed brances can be pruned if caught early enough so that they can be removed by clipping. Once branches have grown enough to require a saw for removal, it is probably too late to prune them, as wounds of koa trees allow entry of wood-rotting fungi.""

But typically, with a canopy spread of 20-40 feet. [16]","Leaves are 2 to over 10 inches long. Koa have sickle-shaped mature ""leaves"" called phyllodes, which are the main photosynthetic organs.  Juvenile leaves, the true leaves, are feathery compounds.","Koa was the most valuable tree in Hawaii. [18] In general, koa wood was also used in constructing houses (hale), spears, tools, paddles (hoe), kahili handles, calabashes (ʻumeke lāʻau), ceremonial poles (hulumanu), religious ceremonies, and short surfboards. [1,3,12,13,17,18] While there were many uses for koa, it was never used for eating  receptacles because the resin, which could not be removed, would leave a  bad taste to foods. [2,18] Canoe: The prime importance of koa for early Hawaiians Early Hawaiians was making of canoes (waʻa), not only the single kinds with an outrigger, kaukahi, but even double kinds, kaulua, which consisted on two canoes lashed together with a yoke in a special way. [18] Small narrow, long, light canoes, called kialoa or kioloa, were suitable for a single fisherman or for racing. Other smaller canoes, about 10 to 20 feet long, could accommodate six to eight men. These canoes were scarcely twelve inches at its widest and about two feet deep. [18] Waʻa peleleu, or simply Peleleu, were long canoes or long voyages were usually 50 feet long, but some were 100 and even 150 feet long had a depth of 6 to 12, and even 15 feet, deep! Such canoes were 1 to 2 feet wide and carved from a single log. Some of these were made from the trunks of gian evergreens that had been carried by ocean currents and winds from the Pacific coasts of America. [18] Dye: The bark was used as dye to stain kapa a red color. [1] Lei: The leaves (phyllodes) were also used in lei making. [8] Medicinal: Koa leaves were placed under a pile of lau hala mats if a person had been in a sick bed for a long time. Leaves were placed on top and spread evenly over the mat to make to person comfortable.The heat that came from the body and the leaves would make the person sweat. [7,9] Someone would wipe the sweat from the person as they fell asleep. This was almost always used for patients with a fever. [7] Young children under a year old who had become weak were given a mixture of koa leaf ash and other plants and applied inside the mouth. [7,9] The bark was applied to pūhō (abscess, burst sore, ulcer), ʻalaʻala (scar, sore perhaps tuberculosis adentis), kaokao (syphilis), leprosy (maʻi lēpela), ʻeha māui (sore bruises), and haki (broken bones). [10] Religion: Koa branches were made into booths for ritual purposes, in dedication of heiau. [18] The Choosing & Making of Canoes The process of selecting the correct tree for making a canoe (waʻa) was more than simply walking into a forest and picking out a tree to be used. Before making a canoe, the Hawaiians employed a Kahuna, or priest, to offer prayers and sacrifices to Kū, the long-bearded god of canoes makers and of war, that the work should be successful. Then, the kahuna aided the men in selecting a suitable tree in the forest. This was a laborious work to fell a tree using a stone adze. The waʻa was then roughly hewn with the same tools. If the native bird ʻelepaio (Chasiempis sp.), or the native crow, ʻalalā (Corvus tropicus),* settled on the log, this was considered an ill omen, and work on it was abandoned. Another tree was selected to take its place. If all went well, there was the chant to move the felled koa: One would cry: ""I kū mau mau!"" (Stand together!). Then from all: ""I kū wā!"" (Shout!) One: ""I kū mau mau! I kū hulu hulu! I kū lanawao!"" (Stand together! Haul with all your might! Under the mighty trees!) All: ""I kū wā!"" (Shout!) One: ""I kū lanawao!"" (Under the mighty trees!) All: ""I kū wā!"" (Shout!) ""I kū wa huki!"" (Shout! Pull!) ""I kū wa ko!"" (Shout! Push!) ""I kū wa a mau!"" (Shout! ...Snagged!) ""A mau ka ēulu!"" (Snagged in the tree top!) ""E huki e!"" (PULL!) ""Kūlia!"" (STRIVE!) [20] Although the waʻa was made from koa, a number of other woods were used to construct and complete the project. Among them were ʻōhiʻa (Metrosideros spp.), ʻahakea (Bobea spp.), wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis), kamani (Calophyllum inophyllum), ʻulu (Artocarpus altilis), kukui (Aleurites moluccana), and hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), to name a few, with the last three being Polynesian introduced plants. [20] _____ * ʻElepaio are only known to have existed on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu and Hawaiʻi Island; ʻAlalā is only known from Hawaiʻi Island. Both are still found today on these islands. While there is no fossil evidence of ʻelepaio found on other islands, there were two other Corvus species found on the islands of Oʻahu and Molokaʻi at the time of early Polynesian settlers.",NA,"Lightly fertilize seedlings 2 or 3 weeks after secondary growth. Since koa are nitrogen fixing trees, additional nitrogen is usually not necessary.","Trees should be spaced 30 to 40 ft. apart.","Koa are not tolerant of salty soils, infertile soils, constant waterlogged soils, constant high winds, or shade.

The large forest koa is well known around the world for the beautiful hard wood. Koa's smaller cousin, koaiʻa, that once grew in the lowlands of most of the main Hawaiian Islands, has an even harder wood that is much prized for its gnarled grain.

Koaiʻa (A. koaia) is also more tolerant than koa (A. koa) to diseases such as koa wilt. [11] Since koaiʻa forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria in its roots for the nitrogen-fixing process, using pesticides around the root area is not recommended.

The Koaiʻa Tree Sanctuary in Kohala (Hawaiʻi Island) is an excellent place to see these trees in one of their last natural habitats. Many grow along the road to Waimea. Sadly, much of koaiʻa habitat has been converted to pasture. [2] ""Lānaʻi has very little koa,"" notes botanist George Munro. But ""koaiʻa can be found widely scattered on the dry country."" [7] Given its natural range throughout the rest of the Main Islands, koaʻa may have possibly been found on Oʻahu in the past as well, though no specimens have been confirmed there. [back to top]","Koaiʻa belong to the third largest plant family, the Pea or Legume family (Fabaceae). There are two endemic species of Acacia in the Hawaiian Islands: Acacia koaia and A. koa.","The generic name Acacia is derived from the Greek, akakia, the name for Acacia arabica, ultimately from akis or ake, a Greek word meaning ""a sharp point"" and referring to the thorns of this particular plant. The specific epithet koaia is from the Hawaiian word for this tree. Hawaiian Names: Koaiʻa and Koaiʻe are the given names for this species. Regarding Koaiʻe, it can figuratively mean a person or anything from the upland country. [10] Koa ʻōha has been used for this species. Regarding this name, Hawaiian Dictionaries online provides this explanation for ʻohā: ""n. Taro corm growing from the older root, especially from the stalk  called kalo; tender plant (Isa. 53.3), shoot, sucker, branch (Isa.  11.2). Fig., offspring, youngsters (FS 235; cf. ʻohana). Also muʻu. See kalo for names of generations. Kai ʻohā, sea with small waves."" [10]","These small trees are nitrogen-fixing and thus very beneficial to a healthy native Hawaiian environment. The growth of koaiʻa is due to the symbiotic relationship with a special bacteria called rhizobia that live in association with the root system. The bacteria convert, or fix, nitrogen from the air into usable nitrogen fertilizer for plants. The leaves, flowers and branches also provide nitrogen for understory plants in the area. Some of the major physical differences between koa (Acacia koa) and koaiʻa (A. koaia) are: Koaiʻa are overall smaller and more compact trees with a denser, harder and more gnarled wood than koa. | Koaiʻa usually have straighter and narrower phyllodes (expanded petioles) than koa. | The seeds of koaiʻa are arranged in pods end-to-end (vertical) as opposed to a side-by-side (horizontal) arrangement with koa. Otto Degener uses ʻakoa as an additional name for koaiʻa. [3]","Koaiʻa is sometimes seen in home and commecial landscapes. Hopefully, it will become a commonly used urban tree since it does so well in lower elevations. Though the wood was apparently readily available to the early Hawaiians, only later in time was it used to make furniture. [10]
The phyllodes (sickle-shaped ""leaves"") are still used to make a nice lei. [6]","[1] ""Growing Koa"" by Kim M. Wilkinson, pages 11-12, 35-36, 39.

The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank;   the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with   divinity. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the  leaves and flowers of koaiʻa were likely used for lei making by early  Hawaiians,  even though there are no written sources.

One of the few native plants that can survive fires, pua kala has been seen to re-appear after soon after an area has been burned. [8]","The genus name Argemone is derived from the Greek argema, cataract, in refernce to the use of the sap of type of poppy reputed to cure cataracts. The specific epithet glauca is from the Greek, glaukos, for blue-green or blue-gray referring to the color of this poppy's leaves. The subspecific name decipiens is from the Latin deceptum, deceptive or misleading. Hawaiian Name:Pua kala literally means ""thorny flower."" [8] This is also the name given to a native lobelia (Cyanea solenocalyx) with prickly leaves, found in gulches of Molokaʻi. The name Pōkalakala is also used for Polyscias racemosa [syn. Munroidendron racemosum].","Pua kala is one of the few endemic plants with prickles or thorns. It is also one of the few truly toxic native Hawaiian plants (See notes under ""Limitations""). Unlike its relative the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), it does not, however, contain morphine or codine. [4] However, pua kala does house alkaloids that irritate the stomach and intestines. [1] But because of the extremely bitter taste there have been few reported poisonings. The acrid taste is also unpalatable to cattle. [1] Strangely, it has been considered as a ""weed"" by some in the Hawaiian Islands, even though it is an endemic plant. [6]","One of the few native plants found in cow pastures. [4] Since cattle [1] and possibly other ungulates (goats, sheep) will not eat pua kala, it may be used the plants as a beautiful and natural border hedge for unwanted grazers from entering into fragile areas.","[1] ""Poisonous Plants of Paradise"" by Susan Scott and Craig Thomas, MD.

[4] With less than 200 of the highly endangered Brighamia rockii remaining in the wild, Huelo Islet’s small population of this declining species is significant. However, these plants occur on Huelo’s steep cliffs and are subject to being killed by soil erosion, rockslides, and falling loulu (Pritchardia hillebrandii). [8] In 2003, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) designated critical habitat in on Mōkapu for rare plants, including Brighamia rockii. Although no longer found here due to rats. However, with the eradication of rats in February 2008, Mōkapu is an important step toward species recovery. [8] Also, in 2003, the USFWS designated critical habitat on Keōpuka for Peucedanum sandwicense and for Brighamia rockii. Although Brighamia rockii is not currently found on the islet, establishing a population on Keōpuka would also be an important step towards species recovery. [8] It is possible that it was formerly found on Lānaʻi (Maunalei Valley) [5] and Maui.

Hawaiian Names: Pua ʻala means ""fragrant flower.""","The two species are similar in some respects. But pua ʻala (Brighamia rockii) from Molokaʻi has white flowers while ālula (Brighamia insignis) has yellow flowers. George Munro says that Hillebrand, an earlier botanist, compared this plant to a ""big cabbage on a naked pole."" [5] While both species can grow to an amazing height of 16 feet, Brighamia insignis tends to be a larger plant than B. rockii. [1,3] Ālula and pua ʻala are perfectly designed for their windy habitats on steep coastal cliffs. The roots penetrate into rocky crevices and the swollen base of the plants allows them to rock in the strong wind. [2] Both species of Brighamia have lost their natural pollinators and now need hand pollination for fruit and seed production. They may have been bird pollinated.

Plants grow in mesic to wet forests. It is usually the first tree fern seen when ascending ridges on Oʻahu to be joined by hāpuʻu ʻiʻi (C. menziesii), where the two occasionally hybridize. Then, there is a gap where tree ferns are few or absent, followed by a dominance of hāpuʻu pulu (C. glaucum) at higher elevations.

The specific name, chamissoi, named for Ludolf Karl Adelbert von Chamisso (1781-1838), French-born German explorer, naturalist, author, poet, and plant collector. Hawaiian Names: The Hawaiian species are best known by the name hāpuʻu collectively, though the early Hawaiians assigned names to different species. The name heiʻi is used by one source for this species. [9] However, Pukui & Elbert do not use this name for this species. [10] In modern times to help with the proper pronunciation, hāpuʻu should be spelled with a kahakō over the ""a."" [7,8]","Wild pigs (puaʻa) have had a severe effect on hāpuʻu populations in some areas, eating the entire starchy inner core thus destroying the plants and leaving a trough for breeding mosquitoes. [7] As long as the growing fronds or fiddles are not destroyed, the ferns can continue to grow. [9] A natural hybrid Cibotium chamissoi x C. menziesii, named C. x heleniae after fern expert Daniel A.

Kauila leaves and bark produce a bluish dye for kapa. [1] Games & Sports:
Kauila wood was also fashioned into spears for the games of spear  throwing (ʻōʻō ihe) and spear fencing (kaka lāʻau). The only use of the  bow and arrows was for a sport called pana ʻiole (rat shoot). Though the  bow was made from an unidentified wood, the arrows were made of kō  (sugarcane) and tipped with bone or kauila wood.

The wood was also crafted into musical instruments, such as hula sticks (ka lāʻau), and was the preferred wood for muscial bows called ʻūkēkē.

Makaloa is ""a general name for shellfish with long sharp edges (e.g. Thais intermedia, Drupa morum).""

Since other plants  crowded it out, barrels or cylindrical containers were placed around the  clumps to encourage longer stems for use. Clothing: Since wauke, used for tapa (kapa) was apparently not grown, or very  limited, on Niʻihau, the makaloa mats were used for making clothing, such as  pāʻū (women's skirts), loincloth (malo), capes (kīhei), and cloaks  (koloka). The finest makaloa mat at the Bishop Museum is 10.5 x 20 feet, with 25  stems per per inch and worn as a cloak by Kemehameha the Great  (Kamehameha I). [10] Incidentally, Kamehameha's full Hawaiian name is  Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i  Kaiwikapu kaui Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea. [11] Cordage: Stem fibers were woven into string or rope. [6,9] Mats: Makaloa is found elsewhere in Polynesia, but only early Hawaiians used them to plait mats. Though makaloa mats were primarily  made on Niʻihau and Kauaʻi, they  were occasionally made on other islands as well. Mats from Niʻihau and Kauaʻi were considered to be the finest in all of Polynesia.  [1,8,9,12] Stems were used whole,  usually not not split, for even finer mats. [5,10,12] The upper yellowish  and the lower reddish parts were used with the shiny side out. [10,12] Makaloa stems were woven into beautiful decorated mats, or moena pāwehe, only by women.  Young plants made the finest mats. [10] The Treasury of Hawaiian Words in One Hundred and One Categories  states that ""young plants yielded the best stems for such plaiting."" [14] Mats were also woven for sails on canoes (waʻa), and for floor and mattress covers (uhi pela). [2,9,10] Another sedge, or rush, kohekohe (Eleocharis obtusa, E. erythropoda) was used to weave design patterns in makaloa mats.  (See Eleocharis erythropoda, ""Special Notes and Information"") Medicinal: Fibers also used to remove impurities form medicinal liquid. [6,9] Stalks were crushed to a fine powder and used to treat deep cuts, boils, skin ulcers and other skin disorders or taken as a snuff for head colds. Flower and stalk ashes mixed with kukui nut juice was rubbed on tongue for general debility. Crushed stalks mixed with water and clay was used to treat burning in male genitals. [6]",NA,"For makaloa plantings in containers that hold water, some fertilizer is beneficial. Be cautious because too much nitrogen can produce green algae in water, especially in the summer months. No fertilizer is necessary in large water features such as fish ponds because the plants will receive their nutrient needs from the watery habitat. Never apply fertilizers to any natural wetlands sites. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]","Makaloa is best propagated by divisions. Clumps need at least 10 to 15 stems and must include an underground rhizome. The clumps can be planted from one to three feet apart. Planted in water or very wet locations and in full sun, makaloa will spread rapidly by rhizomes to form a large fibrous root mat.

Among the fifteen Delissea species, eleven are now extinct and the remaining four are critically endangered.","The generic name Delissea is named for Jacques Delisse (1773-1856), a French physican and botanist from Mauritius, who served as naturalist on the D'Entrecasteaux expedition to the South Pacific in 1800-1804. The specific epithet waianaeensis is in reference to the Waiʻanae Mountains, Oʻahu, where ʻōhā is endemic and very endangered. Hawaiian Names: Hāhā is a name also used for several native species of Brighamia, Clermontia, Cyanea, Cyrtandra, and Gunnera. ʻŌhā and ʻŌhā wai are also general names for many of the Clermontia spp. ʻOha (without kahakō) is used by one publication.

[1] Another species from the Waiʻanae Mts. is Delissea takeuchii, which has not been seen since 1987 and is now considered extinct. The few specimens known were found in the central and southern areas of the Waiʻanae Mts. in wet to mesic forests at about 1800 to 2100 feet in elevation. D. waianaeensis may have hybridized with D. takeuchii. [1] Delissea takeuchii was cultivated by the late University of Hawaiʻi president Laurence Hasbrouck Snyder (1901-1986) at his residence in Mānoa Valley, Oʻahu. [1,5] This specimen, orginally collected near Honouliuli, is no longer existing. [1] Regarding Delissea sobcordata: Delissea waianaeensis has, and continues, to be erroneously referred to as Delissea subcordata. Thomas G. Lammers provides compelling data to show that Delissea subcordata was found only in the Koʻolau Mts., Oʻahu; whereas Delissea waianaeensis is restricted to the Waiʻanae Mts., Oʻahu in mesic to wet forests. Delissea subcordata subsp. subcordata was found in mesic forests in the southern portions of the Koʻolau Mts. from about 390 to over 1500 ft., but now presumed extinct and last collected 1934. Delissea subcordata subsp. obtusifolia was found in mesic forests the central Koʻolau Mts. from about 735 to nearly 1250 ft., also presumed extinct and last collected in 1932. The two subspecies had ""disjunct populations in the central portion"" of the range and came together around Waikāne. These ""intergrades between the two subspecies"" were referred to as the intermediate ""var. waikaneensis,"" but more resembled the subsp. subcordata so as not to warrant a distinct varietal status. [1] The subspecies subcordata flowered from early May through mid-October; fruiting June through October in the souhthern Koʻolau Mts. [1] The subspecies obtusifolia flowered and fruited in October in the central Koʻolau Mts. [1] Interestingly, subsp. subcordata was once cultivated on Tantalus, Oʻahu at botanist George C.

Other native Hawaiian members include two endemics māhoe (Alectryon macrococcus), and lonomea (Sapindus oahuensis), and the indigenous mānele (Sapindus saponaria).","The generic name Dodonaea is named after the Flemish physician and botanist Rembert Dodoens (1517-1585), who was later a professor of medicine at Leiden, The Netherlands.

One can hardly say that there is a typical ʻaʻaliʻi. Three intergrading Dodonaea entities may be recognized in the Hawaiian Islands, possibly to a species level: (1) D. sandwicensis, found occuring in wet motane sites, have mostly 2-winged capsules. [7] This plant is the only one of the three found in wet areas. Apparently endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. [Joel Lau, Botanist] (2) D. viscosa [syn. D. angustifolia, D. eriocarpa, D. spaulata], widespread and pan-tropic but in the Hawaiian Islands this plant is primarily found in open, mesic to dry sites on all the Main Islands. These plants have 3-4-winged capsules that are fuzzy and turgid (swollen). [6] (3) D. stenoptera, which occur primarily on Molokaʻi and scattered sites on Oʻahu (tree-sized), have the largest capsules of the three species and are strongly inflated, 4-winged and wings are short, almost wingless. Apparently these plants are/were found on Lānaʻi and West Maui (two records). [Joel Lau, Botanist] This is a favorite food plant for the Blackburn butterly (Udara blackburni) caterpillars, one of two endemic Hawaiian butterflies, as well as the striking gem-like koa bug (Coleotichus blackburniae). [8] The seeds were a food source for the Hopue or Greater koa-finch (Rhodacanthus palmeri). This beautiful bright orange and green honeycreeper was a native of the koa forests of the Kona and Kaʻū districts of Hawaiʻi Island, but is now extinct. [12] ʻAʻaliʻi is one of the few native Hawaiian plants that can endure fires and is a pioneer plant, that is, seeds survive and plants will return to the burned areas. [8]","Capsules and leaves are still used in lei making as they were with early Hawaiians. [4,9] Used in modern times throughout the world as a poultice or decocted for topical use only. This plant is mildly toxic containing small amounts of cyanogenic toxins and plant materials can cause cyanide poisoning if ingested. [8] ʻAʻaliʻi wood is repotedly termite resistant. [8] The cultivar 'Purpurea,' with purple foliage, is widely used as a shrub on the mainland USA. Use Outside of the Hawaiian Islands: It would not be possible to list all the cultural uses of this plant here. But some examples of the diverse uses are noted below. The wood has been used by many cultures for tool handles, walking sticks, and carving implements. The wood is also good for firewood as it ignites easily. [14] New Zealand's Māori used the wood to fashion clubs and other weapons. The Māori name akeake means ""forever and ever."" Seri, an indigenous people of Sonora, Mexico, use the plants medicinally. On New Guinea, the Yali highlanders use the wood for house construction and firewood, and apply heated leaves as plasters for wounds. [17] The wood is also used for house construction in Southeast Asia, West Africa, and Brazil. [17]","[1] ""Plants in Hawaiian Culture"" by Beatrice H. Krauss, pages 45, 56, 65.

[2,3,9] Dye: The seeds were boiled to make red dye for decorating kapa (tapa) cloth. [1,10] Fishing: The  very hard, durable wood is heavy and sinks in water and so was used for  bait sticks. From a canoe, the bait sticks were lowered into water at a  depth or twenty or so feet to attract fish or heʻe (octopus), which  then could be lured to the surface and caught with a waiting net.  ʻAʻaliʻi was also fashioned into light fishing spears, especially for  heʻe. [1,8,13] Lei: Fruits (capsules) and leaves were used in lei making by early Hawaiians. [1,4,9] Medicinal: The crushed leaves were used as a topical medicine for relief from irritating rashes and contagious diseases such as ringworm or ""haole rot"" and staff infections. [2,5,8,10] Like hops, flowers were used to impart a bitter flavor, and also used as a tonic. [13] For a treatment called holoina, ‘a‘ali‘i leaves are mixed with ala‘a (Planchonella sandwicensis) bark and puakala ku kula (Argemone glauca) root then ground and strained.

[5] But the name is actually spelled without a kahakō over the ""a."" [8]","This ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroides) is the by far the most variable and widespread of all the Hawaiian Chamaesyce. The erect capsules (fruits) distinguish them from other species, except C. herbstii and C. rockii, which have distinctively larger fruits. George C. Munro (1866-1963), botanist and ornithologist, notes in his journals that Lānaʻi once had a unique forest of these treelike ʻakoko was reduced to but a few struggling trees due to uncontrolled eating habits of free range domesticated goats or intentionally burned for charcoal. He notes the following in his journals: ""Within the living memory of three persons when I was on Lānaʻi, ...the plain below Lānaʻi City, the Miki lands, and throughout the Pālāwai Basin, all now growing pineapples, composed of a continous forest of this variety of this species of Euphorbia known to the natives as ʻakoko."" Munro continues: ""Awili Shaw, Naimu, and Henry Gibson, who were all brought up on Lānaʻi, could remember when the ʻakoko forest was intact."" [1] ʻAkoko (Chamaesyce celastroides var. lorifolia) is important for native animal and plant species. Hawaiʻi's only native bees (Hylaeus spp.) use this species as a important food and nesting source. An extinct honeycreeper, the Lānaʻi hookbill (Dysmorodrepanis munroi), searched  for small snails among foliage of ōpuhe (Urera glabra) and perhaps this species of ʻakoko. [1,5,6] It is difficult to believe that these magnificent trees are related to the ubiquitous, pesky weed spurges ever present in our yards. Far from being weedy, however, these rare spurges are in real danger of disappearing altogether.","Early botanists Joseph Rock and George Munro both relate of experiments conducted with the latex from this ʻakoko (Chamaesyce celastroides var. lorifolia). [3] Rock states: ""However, even if the rubber were not of superior grade, the amount of resin in the latex and the easy harvesting possible on Lānaʻi might have made it profitable."" [1,3] A similar event took place on Hawaiʻi Island on Puʻu Waʻawaʻa, North Kona with another tree ʻakoko (Chamaesyce olowaluana). [4] Today, though the vast ʻakoko forests are gone, a few trees still remain on Lānaʻi and Maui, but now a faint reminder of times past. Because of this and other reasons both of the above ʻakoko have now placed in the Vulnerable status.","[1] ""The Story of Lānaʻi"" by George C. Munro, pages 64, 67-68, 212-213.

The native Hawaiian cotton, or maʻo, helped to save the cotton industry  in modern times. When maʻo is crossed with other cotton strains, the  resulting commercial hybrids are less attractive to insect pests that  destroy cotton crops. Cotton  for cloth manufacturing is obtained from the fuzzy seed coating found in  the fruit or capsules. Four species are used commercially cotton  species with the Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) generating about 90% of industry use, and American Pima or Sea island cotton (G. barbadense) with 8%--both naturalized species in Hawaiʻi.

Additionally, there is interest in other agronomic traits of maʻo, such as natural brown lint and heat tolerance. [11] Though this beautiful shrub has declined in many areas, there have been some successful restoration stories as well. Alex Lehman, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, notes one of these on Oʻahu: ""When off-roading near Makapuʻu lighthouse was halted, the maʻo population made a dramatic resurgence.

A very similar species, the Urban chewstick, or  white root (Gouania lupuloides), is used widely by local people  from Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico, and into Central and South America  as a tooth cleaner. A stick about the thickness of the small finger,  with bark removed, is chewed thus strengthening the gums. The stick  produces a slightly bitter, yet aromatic, soap-like froth (saponins)  when chewed. The softened stick is then used by rubbing the teeth much  like a toothbrush. [3] In times past,  dried and powdered forms were exported to Europe and the United States.  Jamaicans still use chewstick for medicine and in a mouthwash called  ""Chew-Dent."" They also use it in making ginger beer, a stronger tasting  ginger ale. Chewstick is also used in brewing beer as a hops substitute and is perhaps why  some Jamaican beers have a distinctive taste.

[1] House Construction: Whether indigenous or a Polynesian introduction, early Hawaiians used pili as their first choice for thatching roofs and for its brown color, neat appearance, and pleasant odor. [1,6,8] Pili was harvested by uprooting a bunch. The soil, roots, and flowering spikes were trimmed and the pili bunch was ready for use. They were tied in rows with stems up, placed close together and worked from the bottom of the frame upwards. Pili thatch was replaced every four or five years. [8] Medicinal: Burned pili and ashes mixed with coconut was used for ʻea (thrush) and pāʻaoʻao (childhood disease with physical weakening). [2] Other Uses: The leaves were also used to stuff mattresses, pad floors, and as a tinder. [3]",NA,"Pili does not require much additional fertilizer to remain healthy.

The subspecies kokio is generally a lanky or straggly shrub, while subsp. saintjohnianus is a tree-like shrub. New DNA evidence suggests that Hibiscus kokio subsp. kokio may now be given full species status as Hibiscus kokio and Hibiscus kahilii.

[back to top]","The large Mallow family Malvaceae contains some 2,300 species, with notables such as okra, cacao, durian, baobab, kenaf, and cotton. [3] There are perhaps as many as 300 species worldwide in the genus Hibiscus. There are six native species of hibiscuses in Hawaiʻi and all but one are endemic.","The generic name Hibiscus is derived from hibiscos, the Greek name for mallow. The specific and subspecific epithet kokio comes from the Hawaiian name for this hibiscus. The subspecies is named after Harold St. John (1892-1991), a professor of botany at University of Hawaʻi Mānoa from 1929 to 1958 and a prolific field botanist, credited with discovering hundreds of new species. [4] Hawaiian Names: The Hawaiian name Kokiʻo ʻula is shared by our two native red hibiscus (Hibiscus clayi and H. kokio). The word ʻula means ""red"" or ""scarlet"" and ʻulaʻula refers to a deeper red. Even though the flowers of subspecies saintjohnianus are orange  (ʻalani), orange-yellow (melemele ʻili ʻalani), or yellow (melemele), and not red (ʻula), they still go by the name Kokiʻo ʻula. Mākū is an additional name for this species, but its meaning is unclear. Other meanings for mākū are ""firm, hard; thick, stiff, as molasses; jellied, solidified; to gel,  harden; to settle, as dregs; to thicken, as cream; dregs, sediment,  lees."" [8] The connection, if any, is uncertain.","When the hibiscus was named as the official flower for the Territory of  Hawaiʻi  by the Legislature in 1923, it was not specified as to any  particular  hibiscus species or variety. This lead to some confusion. In  time many  considered the Native red (Hibiscus kokio) or the  Chinese red  hibiscuses as the state flower. In 1988, however, Hawaii's  State  Legislature resolved the issue by declaring the Native yellow  hibiscus  or Maʻo hau hele (Hibiscus brackenridgei), as the official flower of the State of Hawaiʻi. [9] The two native red hibiscus species, Hibiscus clayi and H. kokio differ in a few ways: The flowers of H. clayi are always red; H. kokio can be red, deep red, orange, or yellow. | Leaves of H. clayi are smooth, or occasionally toothed only near tip; H. kokio leaves are toothed from below middle to the tip (sometimes smooth). | H. clayi is restricted to Kauaʻi; H. kokio is naturally found on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Maui and Hawaiʻi. | H. clayi shrubs are generally more compact in habit or form than H. kokio. New DNA evidence suggests that Hibiscus kokio subsp. saintjohnianus may now be given full species status as Hibiscus saintjohnianus. [10]","Two recognized cultivars for subspecies saintjohnianus are 'Haena Red' and 'Velvet Sunset'. [2] Propagater and grower Dennis Kim has also created a few cultivars such as 'Mary Foster,' 'Keahi,' and 'Gold.'

They do well under cultivation. Plants that have become root-bound in pots tend to remain stunted for a long time. Consequently, it is best to plant ʻōhiʻa into the ground before it becomes pot-bound. [22] Since ʻōhiʻa are nearly in constant bloom, they attract numerous bees and other insects. Keep this in mind when choosing planting sites that may be close the entrances & exits to your home. ʻŌhiʻa are sensitive to root disturbance. A few  planting guidelines can help:  Dig a larger planting hole than the root  ball, perhaps as much as twice  as large. Put good drainage material  such as black or red cinder in the  bottom. When planting ʻōhiʻa never  splay out the root ball  but gently place in hole as is. Nor should  ʻōhiʻa be planted too  deep. Soil should never cover the  surface area around trunk base.  Better to err on the side of planting  too high than too low. Water soil  thoroughly. A final watering of  B-vitamin solution can help to  alleviate stress and encourage new root  growth. For small plants water  everyday until established; larger  plants every two or three days should  suffice. New signs of liko, new  growth, is a key to a successful  planting. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi] These wonderful trees may be grown in containers if provided with full sun and fertilizer applications at half strength.

[3] Early reports from residents said that some dark-colored ʻōhiʻa flowers near Keahikawelo, Lānaʻi were elele (black) or hāuli (brown), but may have been a very dark shade of yellow.

[Rick Barboza, Hui Kū Maoli Ola] Some believe that a pure, or snow white, flower form of ʻōhiʻa exists.

One suggestion is to put cut pieces in a bottle with a small amount of alcohol before disposing. Then, the plant and any others, including relatives (Eugenia spp., Syzygium spp.), in the area should be treated with a fungicide immediately.

Trees and shrubs can be found in or near coastal sites, dry, mesic and wet forests, wind swept slopes and ridges, arid shrublands, sub-alpine, and even saturated mountain bogs perpetually shrouded by mist where mature flowering ʻōhiʻa may grow only a few inches tall. They can even be commonly seen growing as an epiphyte on hāpuʻu (tree fern). ʻŌhiʻa are often among first to pioneer new bare lava flows providing a safe haven for many plants and animals.

Some of these have become  seriously invasives displacing  large tracts of native forests with a  monoscape of a single species. An  extreme example of this is the highly  invasive strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) where little vegetation can grow beneath its dense canopy. Native Metrosideros include five endemic species: Lehua ʻāhihi or ʻāhihi (M. tremuloides), lehua papa (M. rugosa), and three known by the name ʻōhiʻa (M. polymorpha, M. macropus and M. waialealae).

Other native Myrtaceae members include the indigenous Beach cherry or nīoi (Eugenia reinwardtiana), and two endemics: the endangered Koʻolau eugenia or nīoi (Eugenia koolauensis), and the fairly common ʻŌhiʻa hā (Syzygium sandwicensis).","The generic name Metrosideros is derived from the Greek metra, heartwood, and sideron, iron, referring to the very hard wood of these plants. The specific epithet polymorpha, is from the Greek poly, many, and morphos, forms, in reference to the numerous forms or shapes of this species.","As already noted, this paricular species is found in numerous forms. The early Hawaiians recognized these distinctive forms. Among them is the variety pumila which they gave additonal names such as lehua maka noe, lehua neʻeneʻe, and lehua neneʻe. Several native Hawaiian birds feed on the flowers and among the foliage of ʻōhiʻa. Among them are ʻiʻiwi (Vestiaria coccinea), ʻapapane (Himatione sanguinea), and ʻakohekohe (Palmeria dolei) which feed mostly on the flowers and insects; and foraging among the foliage, ʻakiapolaʻau (Hemignathus munroi), the ʻakialoa's (Hemignathus spp.), and the Black mamo or hoa (Drepanis funerea)--the latter two now extinct. Additionally, the coloration of these birds may have served as camouflague, protecting them in pre-historic times from predators such as the Wood harrier (Circus dossenus) and the stilt-owls (Grallistrix spp.), now extinct, and possibly from the still existing Hawaiian hawk or ʻio (Buteo solitarius). [19]","The very hard, strong wood is much prized today for flooring, furniture, decorative poles, carvings, and ʻukulele keys. [20,21] Sapwood is pale brown, grading gradually into reddish-brown heartwood. [21] Wood takes a fine polish, but is difficult to cure. [22] Beautiful lei made with the flowers, buds and liko are still a favorite as they were in times of old. [9] Leaves are still as a pleasant tea in folk remedies. [21] Because of the abundance of nectar, the plants are classed as a honey plant. Lehua or ʻōhiʻa honey (meli) has a unique flavor to it. [21]","[1] ""Plants in Hawaiian Medicine"" by Beatrice H.

[9] Medicinal: A mixture of ʻōhiʻa flowers, the inner bark of the Polynesian-introduced hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), and a little water were given to women in labor when childbirth pangs became intense. Each time the woman had severe pains she was given a mouthful to drink. [1,7,11] The liko (new leaves) would be pounded together with lama leaves, leaf buds and flowers to treat thrush in children. To the mixture was added poi (poi lehua) from kalo lehua, heated with hot stones, then cooled and strained before given to the child. [1,12] Also, the liko were also used to stimulate the appetite and digestion of a weakened child. [4] Kaʻaiakamanu, in his third volume, specifically mentions the use ""Metrosideros collina plym Glaberrima"" in the aforementioned treatment, but states that the ""mother chews the liko,"" as well pounding methods, before administering it to the baby.

[David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi] Lehua ʻāhihi are sensitive to root disturbance. A few planting guidelines can help: Dig a larger planting hole than the root ball, perhaps as much as twice as large. Put good drainage material such as black or red cinder in the bottom. When planting lehua ʻāhihi never splay out the root ball but gently place in hole as is. Nor should lehua ʻāhihi be planted too deep. Soil should never cover the surface area around trunk base. Better to err on the side of planting too high than too low. Water soil thoroughly. A final watering of B-vitamin solution will help to alleviate stress and encourage new root growth.

[1,7,8] The strong wood was also used in house (hale) construction for posts, rafters and perlins. [1,7] Games & Sports: Uhiuhi, or usually māmane, wood was also used for sled runners in a sport for the aristocrats called hōlua. The slopes, or sledding track, called kahua hōlua were usually made with layers of grass or ti leaves. [7,11] The papa hōlua, the sled used for this sport, was made of two narrow  runners and were 7 to 12 or 18 feet long, 2 or 3 inches deep, rounded on  the bottom, and highly polished. The front end tapered off and turned  upward so as not to dig into the soil. The two runners were fastened  together by a number of short pieces of wood laid horizontally across  and lashed to the runners with cordage. Matting on the platform was  lashed to the crossbars separating the runners. Notes the Huliheʻe Palace website: ""The person about to slide gripped the sled by the right hand grip, ran a few yard to the starting place, grasped the other hand grip with the left hand, threw himself forward with all his strength, fell flat on the sled and slid down the hill. His hands held the handgrips and the feet were braced against the last cross piece on the rear portion of the sled. The sport was extremely dangerous as the sleds attained high speed running down hill. Much skill was necessary to keep an even balance and to keep from running off the slide or overturning the sled. In competitions, the sled that went the farthest, won."" [3] Lei: One older source (Charles Gaudichaud,1819) states that Hawaiians ""used  all fragrant plants, all flowers and even colored fruits"" for lei  making. The red or yellow were indicative of divine and chiefly rank;  the purple flowers and fruit, or with fragrance, were associated with  divinity. Because of their long-standing place in oral tradition, the flowers of uhiuhi were likely used for lei making by early Hawaiians,  even though there are no written sources. [4] Medicinal: The bark and young leaves pounded with other plants were pounded, squeezed and liquid taken to purify the blood. [5]",NA,NA,NA,"See above section ""Additional Landscape Use Information.""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Uhiuhi saplings grown in pots do not have a massive root system that fills the pot. So, when removing uhiuhi from the pot much of the soil falls away leaving exposed roots with little or no soil. To prevent this from happening, it is suggested growing plants with fibrous root systems, such as native grasses or koʻokoʻolau (Bidens spp.) in the same pot with uhiuhi. These plants will help to create a root mass in the pot encompassing the uhiuhi roots, and making the transformation to a planting site more successful and less stressful for the uhiuhi. [12] As already mentioned, uhiuhi do not do well in pots. As they grow larger, the roots tend to coil and strangle the plant. Root coiling stunts tree development and can eventually kill the tree. To avoid this until ready to plant out to a site location, they are best grown in deep pots will which allow the roots to grow longer and resulting in healthier trees. When planted out, the longer roots will already be deeper into the soil where it is cooler and where moisture is more likely to be retained during drought-like periods.

[14]","Hala leaves (lau hala) are from 2 to 6 feet long and are spiraled at the end of the branch. The leaves have sharply-toothed margins. Some forms and cultivars have little or no spines along the leaf margins and may not be of Hawaiian origin.","In old Hawaiʻi, hala grew sporadically almost everywhere seeds were carried by streams and the ocean. [15] Hala was very important to the early Hawaiians and they had a number of uses for it. As for the fruits, they were used for various purposes, but prized the red ones were especially prized by early Hawaiians. [15] Agriculture: The early Hawaiians used hala extensively and was thus planted from seed near houses. [4,12] Some trees were also planted in and at edges of villages, as well maintaining large groves. [15] Canoe: The Hawaiians plaited the leaves for canoe sails. Canoes (waʻa) were generally covered with a black paint made from ʻakoko (Euphorbia spp.), inner bark of kukui root, juice of maiʻa (banana) buds, and charcoal of hala leaves, and finished with rubbing with oil of kukui kernals. The black contrast with the unpainted yellow moʻo (gunwales) of ʻahakea (Bobea spp.) wood gave the waʻa a pleasing contrast. [15] Clothing: Hīnano (male flower bracts) were used to plait the finest garments called ʻahu hīnano. The bracts were dried and torn into very narrow strips before plaiting. These garments had a soft, fine texture, and were characterized by marvelous flexibility. [15] Cordage/Fiber: The soft aerial roots (ulehala) of female hala were used as cordage. [1] Some lau hala cordage was formed into rings called pōʻaha to support bowls with rounded bottoms. [12] When ʻahuʻawa (Cyperus javanicus) was not scarce or not available, hala fiber were gathered together in a sizable bundle and used for straining awa (kava). [15] Food: The  sweet fresh fruit tips were only eaten as famine food by the early  Hawaiians because of the presence of irritating raphides (crystals of calcium oxalate), similar the effects by eating raw kalo (taro). [2,15] In times of famine, children would break open the very hard stony coverings of mature keys to eat the tasty nut-like centers. [12,15] Games & Sports: Small stuffed cubicals were made for ball games. [11] Kites were also made with crude plaiting. [15] House Construction: The wood of male trees was used for house (hale) construction for ceilings and, where it was abundant, lau hala was used for roof thatching. Female hala (hala hua) wood was too soft for construction use. [2,3,9,11,12,15] Household Furnishings: The leaves (lau) were used in plaiting baskets, mats and mattresses, cubical pillows stuffed with lau hala pulu, hats,  sandals (kāmaʻa) for  walking on rough lava, and fans to cool  themselves. [2,3,9,11,12,15] The bracts of hīnano (male flowers) were used in plaiting very fine textured and fragrant mats called moena hīnano. Hala leaves (lau hala) were carefully prepared by stripping off thorny edges, washed, bleached in sea water, soaked for several days, passed through smoke to soften, sun dried, lightly pounded with a bone tool, and rolled up. Preparation and plaiting was done by women. [11,12] Lei: Fiber from root tips of female hala were used to string lei. [15] Very different from the female fruits (keys), the fragrant bracts of the  male hala flower (hīnano) were fashioned into strikingly beautiful lei  and were used with or without the flowers themselves. [6] The ripe hala keys (hala ʻiʻo) used for lei were cut by a shark tooth horizontially in three different ways according to desired use. [15] Hard hala keys (hala iwi nui) were not used for lei. [16] Several fruit (keys) forms were used for various reasons. At least six color forms are known and were frequently used by the lei maker: Hala. The common yellow to red keys. | Hala ʻīkoi. Keys are lemmon colored at base; bright orange upper half. | Hala lihilihi ʻula. Keys are bright yellow at base, changing to brigt red-orange at top. | Hala melemele, or Hala maoli. Bright yellow keys. | Hala pia. Small canary yellow keys; prized. | Hala ʻula. Orange red keys; very much prized. [6,16] Because the name hala means to ""pass away"" or  ""die,"" lei made from hala were only for personal use by early Hawaiians  and never presented to others, except with malice. The name hala is also  translated as sin, vice, offense, fault, error, or failure, and not  worn at certain times being considered as ""bad luck."" [6] Many who work with hala today, do not accept this. Medicinal: Young aerial or prop root tips, before reaching the ground called ""scales,"" were used medicinally, both internally and externally. [15] The soft part of the male flowers (hīnano) were chewed by a mother and  given to infants and young children as a laxative. Adults also used it  for a laxative. [2,5,7] The keys of the form hala pia were used medicinally. [6] The aerial root tips were pounded, juice strained and  heated. [5,7] They were mixed with eucalyptus in a pūloʻuloʻu (steam  bath) to treat colds. [10] A mixture of aerial roots with kō (sugar  cane) and other plants was used as a tonic for mothers weakened by child  birth. The mixture was also given for chest pains. [5,7] When mixed  with other plants, the roots were used in urinary tract infections, low  energy and red eyes. [10] The tips are said to be rich in vitamin B.  [12] Paint Brushes: The dried keys (phalanges, drupes, fruits) were also used as brushes to apply dyes for painting, stenciling designs, and perfuming kapa. [2,15] The mature keys, often after falling from the female tree, were cleaned of nay remaining pulp by combing through the fibers with thin, pointed instruments such as bamboo (ʻohe), and the ends of the fibers cut off evenly. The hard upper end of the key served as a handle for the brush. [15] Wood: The wood of male trees (hala hīnano) is said to be beautiful, but not as common as females which have soft wood.  The hard wood was used for canoe rollers, and occasionally for bowls.  [12]  The softer wood centers were hollowed out and used for pipes to  channel water from one kalo (taro) loʻi to another. [2] Hīnao & Love Supposedly, hīnano acted as an aphrodisiac. The entire hīnano stem of flowers (inflorescence) was picked by a girl and chased the boy of her choice with it. Upon catching him, she would beat him on the head with it. The pollen freed by this action,covered his head and would make him fall in love with her. In another use, the pollen was at times seriously collected and place in a drink, upon which the ""victim"" would drink the love concotion without being aware of its purpose! [15]",NA,"For young hala, an application of a balanced slow release fertilizer with minor elements every six months.  Mature plants do not appear to need the additional fertilizer to thrive. Foliar feed young plants monthly with kelp or fish emulsion, or a water-soluble fertilizer with a dilution of one-half of the recommended strength. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi]","Plants should be spaced 20 to 30 feet apart. For shrubs or denser plantings, hala can be planted from 5 to 15 feet apart, if managed, for foliage.","Hala leaf edges are serrated in most varieties and aerial roots in public areas may be hazardous. Features to keep in mind when planting along high foot traffic locations. [back to top]","View Photo Gallery",NA,NA,"The ripe fruits of the female hala are fragrant.

The species name sandwicensis refers to the ""Sandwich Islands,"" as the Hawaiian Islands were once called, and named by James Cook on one of his voyages in the 1770s. James Cook named the islands after John Montagu (The fourth Earl of Sandwich) for supporting Cook's voyages. Hawaiian Names: Pōpolo kū mai is a name also used by another unrelated plant, the very rare native Solanum imcompleteum.","The Hawaiian pokeberry or Pōpolo kū mai, is one of the few truly poisonous  native plants to mammals and humans. Birds, however, are unaffected by the toxins and feed on the berries which help in seed dispersal. All parts pf the plants contain alkaloid phytolaccine and  other triterpene toxins which impair formation or damage of red blood  cells. The toxins also irritate the digestive system and can affect the  central nervous system. [1] The non-native red inkplant (Phytolacca octandra) is naturalized on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and Maui, and hybridizes with pōpolo kū mai where the two species occur together.","So, given its toxic nature, why would one want to grow pōpolo kū mai in their garden? Well, we might be  surprised to learn that many plants we have growing in our own yard, or even inside our homes,  are many times more toxic than our native pokeberry. The combination of good knowledge, common sense, and caution are keys with handling any plant that one is unfamiliar with. That said, pōpolo kū mai are attractive shrubs, especially  during flowering and fruiting, and have potential for future landscaping  needs. These have recently been seen more in landscapes and introduced by native Hawaiian plant enthusiasts. They appear to grow well from near sea level and lower elevations (at least down to 300 ft.) in Hawaiʻi.

[1]  It has been noted that in a well-known Hawaiian collection, it is  estimated that more than a third of the kapa samples were made from  māmaki (Pipturus spp.) [9] Māmaki for tapa was mostly made on the island of Hawaiʻi. On other islands, māmaki was usually mixed with wauke when used for kapa. [13] ʻŌlapa bark and kūpaoa (Dubautia  spp.) were used to scent māmaki kapa. [12] Medicinal: Women ate māmaki fruits and seeds during the later months of pregnancy. [1,6] The fruit was also used in healing sores and wounds. [4] Mothers gave the small white fruit to children as a mild laxative or to treat ʻea (thrush). [1,4,13] Seeds were given to infants and adults as a tonic for general debility of the body.

Birds such as 'ō'ō and mamo were plucked of their few moulting yellow   feathers and set free to grow more for the next season. However, this was not the case with the ʻiʻiwi, ʻamakihi and ʻapapane which were totally covered with red- or green-colored feathers and would not have survived the plucking. They were captured, plucked and eaten. [1,3] Medicinal: The milky sap from pāpala kēpau (Pisonia spp.) was used for cuts.

William Hillebrand (1821-1886), was a young Prussian physician and plant collector when he came to the islands to live in 1850. An enthusiastic botanist, Hillebrand planted many of the plants he collected on the grounds of Queen's Hospital and also on his own property in Nuʻuanu. After moving back to Germany, the property was sold to his neighbors Thomas & Mary Foster. Today, it is known as the Foster Botanical Gardens. It was sometime after 1851 that this loulu was planted by Dr. Hillebrand. The original habitat of this species, then known as Pritchardia macrocarpa, was in the upper end of Nuʻuanau Valley on Oʻahu and thought to be extinct when it was recently rediscovered.

Today, loulu concentrate on growing on the remains of the agricultural terraces built by the earlier residents. [5] Humans lived on Nīhoa for sometime, but loulu did make a comeback. In July 1885, however, a fire accidentally set by someone in the large party of 200 accompanying Princess Liliʻuokalani's visit, destroyed most of the loulu on the island. [5] Censuses since then indicate that the palms have been making a slow recovery over the years. Pritchardia remota is today considered rare and critically endangered with less than 700 found in a 1996 survey remaining on Nīhoa. [3,5] Potential sites for re-establishment include Necker (Molumanamana), Laysan (Kauō), Midway (Pihemanu), and Kauaʻi. [5] Pritchardia remota is related to P. glabrata, P. hillebrandii, P. kaalae,  and P. maideniana. [11] On Nīhoa, loulu provide nesting and roosting habitat for seabirds.

Pteridium aquilinum is probably the most common fern in the world, found on every continent except Antartica and in dry deserts. The variety decompositum is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.","The generic name Pteridium is derived from the Greek pteris, fern, and pteron, wing or feather, in reference to fronds suggesting the spread wings of a bird. The specific epithet aquilinum, is Latin for eagle (Aquila). The varietial name decompositum is from the Latin de, very, and compositus, compound, in reference to the frond division. Hawaiian Names: The name kīlau is also used for a ti (kī)  stalk with shredded leaves, as held by a fishing director (kilo iʻa) and  used to guide the fishing canoes; ti stalk used to flip water of  purification. [5]","Kīlau are one of the few deciduous native plants in the Hawiian Islands. Fronds turn brown and die back in the winter, although rhizomes are still alive. In the early spring, bright green fiddleheads (fronds) emerge. Then by late summer or early, the mature fronds will turn brown and eventually die back by the winter. [4] However, it has been noticed that some lower elevation plants may remain green year round or only some of the fronds may die back. [David Eickhoff, Native Plants Hawaiʻi] In many countries bracken is often treated as a weed and spoil pastures for grazing animals because of its poisonous properties. [3] However, feral pigs favor the rhizomes and will root up entire patches. [4]","In Hawaiʻi, kīlau is collected and use in  wasari. But ""because bracken fern has cancerous properties and a nerve  poison, it should be eaten infrequently and in moderation."" [2] A substitute for bracken, is the Vegetable fern (Diplazium esculentum),  naturalized in Hawaii, and often called hōʻiʻo in local markets. Hōʻiʻo  can be prepared the same way as bracken, but ""is not known to have  these anti-nutritional qualities so it can be eaten freely."" [1] The  species name esculenta is Latin for edible, alluding to the use of this fern for food. [1] Outside of the Hawaiian Islands: Bracken has been used throughout in many cultures around the world. The fiddlehead (immature unfurled fronds) are bitter, but used fresh, cooked, or preserved by pickling, salting, or sun drying. For example, in Korea, called gosari, they are used in bibimbap or gosari-namul, a sauteed side dish; and as a vegetable dish in Japan, called wasari. [2] Native Americans pound the rhizomes in making a stachy flour for bread; and in Japan used a starch to make confections. [2] Bracken has been used as fodder for animals, but it can injure or poison them. So, it often used as litter in animal pens.

Santalum ellipticum var. ellipticum has been recorded from Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu (Waiʻanae Mountains, Koʻolau Mountains, and the central plains between the two mountain ranges), Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe (extirpated), Maui (West Maui, East Maui), and Hawaiʻi (Kohala Mountains to North Kona).

[3] [back to top]","ʻIliahialoʻe and ʻiliahi belong to the Sandalwood family or Santalaceae which comprises about 1,000 species worldwide and includes several species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands in the genera Santalum, Exocarpus and Korthalsella. Currently there are six endemic species in the Hawaiian Archipelago. [10]","The generic name Santalum is derived from santalon, the Greek name for sandalwood. The specific epithet ellipticum is from the Latin ellipticus, oblong with rounded ends, in reference the shape of the leaves of this species. Hawaiian Names: Lāʻau ʻala literally means ""sweet wood"" or ""fragrant wood.""","ʻIliahi and ʻiliahialoʻe are hemiparasitic, which means they derive some nutrients from their host but are not totally dependent on them as are other native plants such as mistletoe or hulumoa (Korthalsella spp.), kaunaʻoa (Cuscuta sandwichiana), and kaunaʻoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis)--all of which are parasitic. [4] The Sandalwood Trade Story: As  with other Hawaiian sandalwoods, ʻiliahialoʻe was subject to the  Sandalwood trade from 1790 to the early 1800's. Most of the sandalwood  shipped from Hawaiʻi came from the lowlands and this species was one of  those used in the trade. [3,4] The  captivating scent of the heartwood has   fueled greed among men throughout  the world. This was the case with a   collaboration of Chinese, American  and Hawaiian merchants and monarchy   in the late 18th century. Due to  China's, as well as a few other   countries, insatiable appetite for  sandalwood, the white sandalwood (Santalum album) imported from India was becoming scarce because of over harvesting and, even to this day, it is an endangered species. With  fewer imports from India, and with the   help of American fur traders,  China now turned their attention to the   Hawaiian sandalwoods or ʻiliahi  and ʻiliahialoʻe. From the 1790's to   mid-1830's, ʻiliahi and the  Hawaiian people who harvested the logs   experienced an incredible  hardship with the exportation of sandalwood   to China. For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area   began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],   or the ""Sandalwood  Mountains."" [6] Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of   the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and   worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were   devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as   laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,   disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaiʻi   suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7] By  the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the   remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand   down. Even naio (Myoporum spp.) was trying to  be passed off as   genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired the   pitiful nickname ""bastard sandalwood."" In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)   placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By   1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]   Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but   not without scars. While not as common as  in the past, ʻiliahi and   ʻiliahialoʻe are fairly easy to see in its  native habitat though very   large trees are still difficult to find.",NA,"[1] ""Hawaiʻi's Vanishing Flora"" by Bert Y.

Currently there are six endemic species in the Hawaiian Archipelago. [8]","The generic name Santalum is derived from santalon, the Greek name for sandalwood. The specific epithet haleakalae is named for Haleakalā, Maui where this species is found. Hawaiian Names: Lāʻau ʻala lietrally means ""sweet wood"" or ""fragrant wood.""","ʻIliahi and ʻiliahialoʻe are hemiparasitic, which means they derive some nutrients from their host but are not totally dependent on them as are other native plants such as mistletoe or hulumoa (Korthalsella spp.), kaunaʻoa (Cuscuta sandwichiana), and kaunaʻoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis)--all of which are parasitic. [3] The Sandalwood Trade Story: The  captivating scent of sandalwood's heartwood has   fueled greed among men throughout  the world. This was the case with a   collaboration of Chinese, American  and Hawaiian merchants and monarchy   in the late 18th century. Due to  China's, as well as a few other   countries, insatiable appetite for  sandalwood, the white sandalwood (Santalum album) imported from India was becoming scarce because of over harvesting and, even to this day, it is an endangered species. With  fewer imports from India, and with the   help of American fur traders,  China now turned their attention to the   Hawaiian sandalwoods or ʻiliahi  and ʻiliahialoʻe. From the 1790's to   mid-1830's, ʻiliahi and the  Hawaiian people who harvested the logs   experienced an incredible  hardship with the exportation of sandalwood   to China. For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area   began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],   or the ""Sandalwood  Mountains."" [6] Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of   the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and   worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were   devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as   laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,   disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaiʻi   suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7] By  the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the   remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand   down. Even naio (Myoporum spp.) was trying to  be passed off as   genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired the   pitiful nickname ""bastard sandalwood."" In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)   placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By   1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]   Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but   not without scars. While not as common as  in the past, ʻiliahi and   ʻiliahialoʻe are fairly easy to see in its  native habitat though very   large trees are still difficult to find.","Today, the fruit is sometimes used as a dye.

With  fewer imports from India, and with the  help of American fur traders,  China now turned their attention to the  Hawaiian sandalwoods or ʻiliahi  and ʻiliahialoʻe. From the 1790's to  mid-1830's, ʻiliahi and the  Hawaiian people who harvested the logs  experienced an incredible  hardship with the exportation of sandalwood  to China. For obvious  reasons, the Chinese in the Canton-Macao area  began to call the Hawaiian  Islands Tang Heung Shan [Tahn Heung Sahn],  or the ""Sandalwood  Mountains."" [6] Many thousands of  Hawaiians, at the order of  the aliʻi, under Kamehameha I (the Great),  left off agriculture and  worked to supply the Sandalwood Trade. The  consequences were  devastating. Many of the common people (makaʻāinana)  who were used as  laborers died from exposure to cold weather,  exhaustion, malnutrition,  disease or other causes. As a result, during  this dark period Hawaiʻi  suffered through one of the worst famines in  its history. [7] By the  mid-1830's, the sandalwood supply was nearly  exhausted and the  remaining inferior or smaller pieces were driving  prices and demand  down. Even naio (Myoporum spp.) was trying to  be passed off as  genuine sandalwood with little success. Naio has thus  acquired a  pitiful nickname ""bastard sandalwood."" In  1839, King Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli)  placed a kapu on the remaining  ʻiliahi, reserving it for himself. By  1840 the Hawaiian sandalwood trade  basically came to a finish. [8]  Fortunately, the people, the land and  the ʻiliahi have recovered but  not without scars. While not as common as  in the past, ʻiliahi and  ʻiliahialoʻe are fairly easy to see in its  native habitat though very  large trees are still difficult to find.","In the latter part of the 20th century S. paniculatum wood was exported form western Hualālai (Kona District, Hawaiʻi) to Asia. [1] Currently there is still contriversal some logging being done with this species.

Marquesas, the Society Is.), Africa, and the island of Hawaiʻi. [7,8] Otto Degener (1899-1998), botanist in Hawaiʻi, observed that the dried fruits have an air space within that helps them to float in water. He observed that about half the seeds, without fruit, also would float. Seeds are often found in beach drift on various islands thus explaining the disjunct distribution of this species. Botanist Joseph F. Rock (1884-1962) found that the Hawaiian trees attain a larger size in height and trunk diameter than anywhere on the mainland. [6] Mānele is one of a few native Hawaiian trees that are deciduous or partly deciduous, that is, that they seasonally loose their leaves. The heavy and hard sapwood is whitish and the heartwood is yellow or light brown. [6] The seeds and leaves are reported as being toxic if eaten. [1]","The jet black seeds can be strung on lei as they were in times past. [3,4,5] Uses Outside of Hawaiʻi: The hard wood is used for posts and in capentry.

In ancient times, one version goes, there was a beautiful Hawaiian princess known as Naupaka. One day, the villagers noticed that Naupaka looked very sad. They told her parents, who approached Naupaka and asked her what was troubling her.
“I have fallen in love with a man named Kaui,” replied the princess. “But Kaui is not of noble birth—he is a commoner.” According to Hawaiian tradition, it was strictly forbidden for members of royalty to marry people from the common ranks.
Distressed, Naupaka and Kaui traveled long and far, seeking a solution to their dilemma. They climbed up a mountain to see a kahuna who was staying at a heiau (temple). Alas, he had no clear answer for the young lovers. “There is nothing I can do,” he told them, “but you should pray. Pray at this heiau.”
So they did. And as they prayed, rain began to fall. Their hearts torn by sorrow, Naupaka and Kaui embraced for a final time. Then Naupaka took a flower from her ear and tore it in half, giving one half to Kaui. “The gods won’t allow us to be together,” she said. “You go live down by the water, while I will stay up here in the mountains.”
As the two lovers separated, the naupaka plants that grew nearby saw how sad they were. The very next day, they began to bloom in only half flowers.
There are different versions of the naupaka legend, but all carry the same unhappy theme: lovers that are separated forever, one banished to the mountains, the other to the beach.

The featured species is the only indigenous naupaka, or scaevola, and the only one to produce white fruit in the Hawaiian Islands. The others are endemic and all produce dark purple fruits.","The generic name Scaevola is derived from the Greek scaevus, left-handed or awkward, perhaps in reference to the ""awkward"" appearance of the ""half flower"" or to the signature flowers resembling an open fan or hand. Since the specific epithets sericea and taccada seem to go back and forth in revisions, we have include the etymology for both. The specific epithet sericea is derived from the Latin sericeus, silky or sikly-hairy, likely in reference to the short hairs found on the foliage of this plant. [7] The specific epithet tacccada is [needed] Hawaiian Names: Aupaka is a Niʻihau name for this plant. Huahekili means ""hailstones."" [8] Naupaka kahakai means ""naupaka by the seashore.""","The pulpy fruits tolerate salt water and float on the ocean currents for dispersal to other islands, unlike the dark purple fruits of the other native naupaka species which are eaten and dispersed by birds. However, the seeds of naupaka kahakai will only germinate with fresh water. [9] The Legend:
In ancient times, one version goes, there was a beautiful Hawaiian princess known as Naupaka. One day, the villagers noticed that Naupaka looked very sad. They told her parents, who approached Naupaka and asked her what was troubling her.
“I have fallen in love with a man named Kaui,” replied the princess. “But Kaui is not of noble birth—he is a commoner.” According to Hawaiian tradition, it was strictly forbidden for members of royalty to marry people from the common ranks.
Distressed, Naupaka and Kaui traveled long and far, seeking a solution to their dilemma. They climbed up a mountain to see a kahuna who was staying at a heiau (temple). Alas, he had no clear answer for the young lovers. “There is nothing I can do,” he told them, “but you should pray. Pray at this heiau.”
So they did. And as they prayed, rain began to fall. Their hearts torn by sorrow, Naupaka and Kaui embraced for a final time. Then Naupaka took a flower from her ear and tore it in half, giving one half to Kaui. “The gods won’t allow us to be together,” she said. “You go live down by the water, while I will stay up here in the mountains.”
As the two lovers separated, the naupaka plants that grew nearby saw how sad they were. The very next day, they began to bloom in only half flowers.
There are different versions of the naupaka legend, but all carry the same unhappy theme: lovers that are separated forever, one banished to the mountains, the other to the beach.

Most commonly seen on East Maui and Hawaiʻi Island at higher elevations. Apparently rare on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu and Molokaʻi; extinct on Lānaʻi (?). [12] [back to top]","Māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) is a member of the Pea or Legume family (Fabaceae). There are about 50 species in the genus Sophora, with māmane as the sole representative in the Hawaiian Islands. Some interesting kin in the genus are eight yellow-flowered species from New Zealand known as Kōwhai (Māori for yellow); the fascinating Yellow necklace pod (Sophora tomentosa) with constricted round seed pods; Ku-Shen (S. flavescens), a Chinese medicinal herb; and Toromiro (S. toromiro), the last of the endemic trees from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) that was barely saved from extinction.","The generic name Sophora is derived from the Arabic name for some papilionaceous (papilio, butterfly) tree, in reference to the pea-shaped flowers resembling a butterfly. The specific epithet chrysophylla is derived from the Greek chryso, golden, and phyllum, leaves. Hawaiian Names: The name Mamano is used by one source. [12] However, Pukui & Elbert have no reference for the name for this species. [13]","Māmane leaf buds, flowers, and especially the green seed pods, are a main food source for the palila (Loxiodes balleui), an endangered honeycreeper now restricted to the māmane/naio forests of Mauna Kea, Hawaiʻi Island. The palila formerly had a much larger range on Hawaiʻi Island, south to the e. slope of Hualālai and n.w. slope of Mauna Loa. Fossil records indicate that it also once inhabited the dry lowland forests of Oʻahu (Barber's Point) and Kauaʻi. [9] Incidentally, māmane is/was also recorded at living nearly at sea level just above 100 ft. [10,11,12] Additionally, the yellow and green coloration of these birds may have served as camouflague among the trees, protecting them in pre-historic times from predators such as the Wood harrier (Circus dossenus) and the stilt-owls (Grallistrix spp.), and possibly from a hawk (Buteo sp.) on Oʻahu--all now extinct. Perched among the branches palila are nearly indistinguishable among the bright yellow māmane flowers and grayish green seed pods and leaves. [8] Māmane is fire tolerant and often after burns seedlings can be seen sprouting. They cannot however tolerate feral goats and sheep feeding upon them. [7]","Years ago the hard, durable wood was used in fences. [5] The seeds can be strung on a beautiful permanent lei and flowers as temporary lei. Soaked seeds produce a bright yellow to amber colored water and possibly could be used to make a yellow dye. Wood is still used today to smoke meat.

The slopes, or sledding track, called kahua hōlua  were usually made with layers of grass or ti leaves. [6,15] The papa hōlua, the sled used for this sport, was made of two narrow runners and were 7 to 12 or 18 feet long, 2 or 3 inches deep, rounded on the bottom, and highly polished. The front end tapered off and turned upward so as not to dig into the soil. The two runners were fastened together by a number of short pieces of wood laid horizontally across and lashed to the runners with cordage. Matting on the platform was lashed to the crossbars separating the runners. [15] Notes the Huliheʻe Palace website: ""The person  about to slide gripped the sled by the right hand grip, ran a few yard  to the starting place, grasped the other hand grip with the left hand,  threw himself forward with all his strength, fell flat on the sled and  slid down the hill. His hands held the handgrips and the feet were  braced against the last cross piece on the rear portion of the sled. The  sport was extremely dangerous as the sleds attained high speed running  down hill. Much skill was necessary to keep an even balance and to keep  from running off the slide or overturning the sled. In competitions, the  sled that went the farthest, won."" [16] House Construction: The strong wood was used for posts, rafters and thatching posts or purlins in house (hale) construction. [5,6] Lei: The bright yellow flowers were used in lei making. [1,3,4] Medicinal: Māmane flowers were used as astringent. [15] Other Uses: The wood was fashioned into scraping board for olonā, adze handles, and farm spades.

There are eighteen species in the genus Thespesia but perhaps the best known and widely distributed one is the pantropic portia or milo (Thespesia populnea).","The generic name Thespesia is derived from the Greek thespesios, divine, referring to T. populnea, which was collected in Tahiti by Captain Cook's expedition in 1769 and was reported to be a sacred tree and planted around places of worship. The specific epithet populnea, poplar-like, likely in reference to the leaves resembling some poplar (Populus spp.) tree species. Hawaiian Name: Milo means to twist, curl, or spin. This name is also used in the Marshall Islands and American Samoa. [15]","This is probably an indigenous tree. However, to date, there is no conclusive evidence to support milo as indigenous. [6,12,14] Even so, milo is also one of the canoe plants that the Polynesians brought with them to the islands, and certainly not invasive as its non-native cousin hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), also brought in by the early settlers. The fruits and seeds are salt tolerant and are distributed island to island by sea. The seeds will germinate even after a year in seawater. [15] Even though the flowers and young leaves are reported to be mildly poisoness, [15] milo is one of the few plants that were listed as an emergency food during World War II in a manual called “Emergency Food Plants and Poisonous Plants of the Islands of the Pacific” by the War Department. It states that “the purpose of this manual is to aid the individual who becomes separated from his unit…so that this individual can live off the land.” It then briefly identifies the plant and how to prepare it. [8]","Today, the seeds are sometimes strung for permanent lei. [2] The dark heartwood is moderately heavy, durable, and easy to work with. The wood has low shrinkage rate when drying [15] and has been fashioned into beautiful items such as carvings, bowls and platters. [11,12,13] Milo is also used in boat building and in cabinet making. [15] In Hawaiʻi and elsewhere in the tropics, milo is sometimes used as street or park trees, or as a living fence. [15] Uses Outside of Hawaiʻi: In the West Indies, where cotton is an important crop, this naturalized species is eradicated because it is a host of the cotton stainer (Dysdercus sp.), a red insect that stains fibers of growing cotton. [15] Thespecia garckeana from East Africa has edible fruits. The fibers of Thespecia lampas from Africa to the Philippines is like sunn or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), which is more durable than jute.

Hawaiian Name: Nohu is also the name of scorpionfishes (Scorpaenopsis cacopsis and other scorpaenids) with poisonous spines. (See Did You Know...? near the top of this page.","The ecological importance of Tribulus cistoides is noted by the following: ""In 1896, nohu occurred 'almost everywhere on the island, especially in sandy areas between the single Eragrostis bunches' (Schauinsland 1899). This quote suggests that at the turn of the century, nohu was somewhat more common on Laysan than it is currently. It was one of the few plants to survive the devegetation by rabbits...Its relatively large, spiney seeds probably aided in its ability to withstand the rabbits' grazing. Also, as the Laysan Finch population fell during the island's devegetated stage, finch predation on nohu and other seeds may have decreased, allowing a seed bank to remain. Laysan Ducks have been reported to forage under nohu, and the now extinct Laysan Honeycreeper got nectar from it (Munro 1960)."" [2] The Laysan finch (Telespiza cantans) feed on nohu seeds, leaves, flowers, runners, and seedlings as a minor part of their diet. [2,3] However, the 1967 experimental introduction of Laysan finches to Pearl and Hermes Reef used nohu as a major part of their diet. [3] It should be noted that there were fifteen native species to the islands of Pearl and Hermes Reef, only of which one is now extinct (Achyrathes atollensis). An important natural habitat of nohu, pōhuehue (Ipomoea pes-caprae), and alena (Boerhavia repens) currently exists on Laysan. [2]","Nohu has been generally viewed by many as a weed and to be eradicated. The spiny fruit of nohu can be quite painful if stepped on barefoot. The spines will even puncture rubber slippers. Thus, modern views of nohu  are often negative, resulting in beaches and other porpulated locations being totally  cleared of this native plant.

It is also the most distinctive and easily recogized Vaccinium species in Hawaiʻi. They may be an important seasonal component in the diet of ʻōmaʻo or Hawaiian thrush (Myadestes obscurus). [7] NOTE:  All species of ʻōhelo have edible berries. An unrelated native plant ʻākia (Wikstroemia  spp.) often grows in the same habit as ʻōhelo and both have red  berries. But to the untrained eye the two can be mistaken for the same  plant. While ʻōhelo berries are edible, ʻākia berries are not and  some species are even reported to be poisonous! For good reason, then,  ʻākia are known by the common name ""false ohelo."" The differences  between the plants are easy once you take time to learn them. Please take the time to learn them. You can do so by visiting a number of plant profiles for Wikstroemia on this site.","ʻŌhelo, in general, are perhaps the most popular native Hawaiian fruit. The berries are used today in making jams, jellies, pie filling or eaten fresh. ʻŌhelo kau lāʻau is probably the least used of the three native species, perhaps because of inaccessibility to good locations for harvesting. Modern roads to the two other higher elevation species has made them easily available and more useable. Too, the fruit of ʻōhelo kau lāʻau is tart, but sometimes added to other ʻōhelo species in jams and jellies.

The early Hawaiians enjoyed eating the berries much as we do today. The fruit was not readily available as everyday food since they grew high in the mountains. But like hikers today, they were considered wild food and eaten when found ripe. [5,6] Medicinally, the  leaf buds, leaves and fruit were combined with other plant material for  abdonimal pains. The ingredients were pounded together into a mash and  strained through the leaves of ʻahuʻawa (Cyperus javanicus), and drunk in the morning and evening. [3,7] New leaves (liko), fruit (berries) and flowers were in used lei making. [3,4,6] ʻŌhelo and Pele: ʻŌhelo  was considered a sacred plant by the early Hawaiians. No one was to eat  any berries without first offering them to Pele, the goddess of fire,  lightening, dance, volcanoes, and violence. With branches of ʻōhelo  berries in hand, they would say: ""E Pele, eia  ka ʻōhelo 'au; e taumaha aku wau ʻia ʻoe, e ʻai hoʻi au tetahi."" (O  Pele, here are your ʻōhelo [branches]; I offer some to you, some I also  eat.) Then, they would toss a portion of the branch with berries  attached into the crater as an offering to Pele. After which they were  allowed to eat some. In 1823, among the first  white people to visit Kīlauea was Reverend William Ellis and his  missonary entourage, accompanied by Hawaiians. On the journey, when the  missonaries became hungry they ate some ʻōhelo berries and were quickly  warned to give some to Pele first before partaking of them. Ellis wrote,  ""We told them ...that we acknowledged Jehovah  as the only divine  proprietor of the fruits of this  earth, and felt thankful to Him for  them, especially  in our present circumstances. We traveled on,   regretting that the natives should indulge in notions  so  superstitious."" [1] Following the example of  Ellis, in December 1824, the High Chiefess Kapiʻolani (c.1741-1841) set  out on a mission from Kona to visit the still active Kīlauea where she  would dare Pele to do her worst, even though her husband and others  tried to dissaude her. She made the long journey of about one hundred  miles mostly by foot with a large company. There she was met by a  preistess of Pele threatening her with Pele's displeasure if she  continued with her hostile errand, and prophesied that she and her  followers would perish miserably. With defiance, she descended into the  crater, gathered ʻōhelo berries and ate them without first offering them  to Pele, and threw rocks into the crater to insult the goddess. She and  her eighty followers went to the edge of Halemaʻumaʻu caldera and  addressed her followers: ""Jehovah is my God. He kindled these fires. I  fear not Pele. If I persih by the anger of Pele, then you may fear the  power of Pele; but if I trust in Jehovah, and he should save me from the  wrath of Pele, when I break her tabus [taboos], then you must fear and  serve the Lord Jehovah. All the gods of Hawaii are vain!"" Then they sang  hymns. [1,2] There was no wrath from Pele.  Kapiʻolani and her followers did not succumb to any horrible death as  prophesized they surely would.",NA,"ʻŌhelo kau lāʻau benefit greatly from a monthly foliar feeding of kelp and/or fish emulsion at half strength.

[back to top]","ʻĀkia belong to Daphne family (Thymelaeaceae). There are a dozen endemic species in the Hawaiian Islands. Wikstroemia monticola is a close relative of W. uva-ursi. The main difference is that W. monticola is always a small tree, whereas W. uva-ursi is a sprawling shrub.","The genus is named for Johan Emanuel Wikström (1789-1856), a Swedish botanist and author of several papers on Thymelaeaceae. The species and varietal name uva-ursi is from the Latin uva, grape or berry, and ursi, bear, literally ""bear's grape"" or bearberry. The varietal name kauaiensis is in reference to Kauaʻi, where it is endemic. Hawaiian Names: Botanist William Hillebrand (1888) states the Hawaiian names for the  genus are ""akia"" or ""akea."" Hillebrand (1888) also states the root of  the word may be in the Fijian name for the genus mati and that the native name for the genus in Tahiti is ovao. [6] The name ʻākia is also shared by Solanum nelsonii, a small endemic shrub in the Solanaceae or Nightshade family. ʻĀkia also means ""to ferment; very sour, as poi. ʻAi ʻākia, sour poi."" [5] Any name realionship is uncertain. Distinctive varieties are named lau nui, mānalo, and pehu. [5] Aoaoa and kauhi are alternate names for this species.","The common name ""false ohelo"" is attributed to the fact that the fruits of ʻākia resemble the orange or red ʻōhelo (Vaccinium spp.) berries. ʻĀkia is sometimes referred to as the ""fish poison plant.""","The fruits can be used in lei. Ethanol extracts from this species has also been shown to have anti-tumor activity. Regarding the toxicity or lack thereof, How to Plant a Native Hawaiian Garden notes this: ""In Hawaii, only the toxicity of Wikstroemia pulcherrima Skottb. has been studied extensively by Dr. Frank Tabrath. W. pulcherrima has caused mice to go to sleep. The toxicity of W. pulcherrima varies from high to zero toxicity even in the same plant at different times.

[3] Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaiʻi, B. Peterson (1990) states that “Species of Wikestroemia  have furnished one of the strongest Hawaiian fibers, used in making  ropes and braids. It is also said to have been used in making kapa.  Measurements made from fibers of branches desiccated for 6 months  demonstrated that the density of Wikestroemia fibers was about the same as that of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) and ramie (Boehmeria nivea)."" The wood, likely from larger species, was used  as ‘auamo (carrying sticks) and [7] also used as a type of ceremonial  firewood in ʻanaʻana magic (Kamakau 1991). [6] Medicinally, the sap of ʻākia (Wikestroemia  spp.) mixed with niu (coconut) and kō kea (white sugarcane) was taken  internally with ‘uala (sweet potato) as a purgative. The leaves and leaf  buds were mixed with the bark of ‘ōhi‘a ‘ai (Syzygium malaccense) and ‘uhaloa root (Waltheria indica),  niu, kō ‘aina kea (a sugarcane variety). Plant material was pounded,  water added, strained, and the liquid taken internally for wai‘ōpua pa‘a  (leukorrhea) and nae kūlou (shortness of breath?). [7] Roots,  bark, leaves and stems were used as a  poison to stupefy fish called hola which were  then gathered by the  early Hawaiians. The plant parts were crushed,  placed in a porous  container, and sunk in salt water pools. The fish  were safe to eat  because ʻākia is not known to be poisonous to  warm-blooded creatures by  means of this fishing method. [3] So is ʻĀkia Poisonous or Not? Alkaloids can be extracted from various parts of  the plants, and ʻākia has an old reputation for being poisonous.  Reputable sources mention that ʻākia was used in old Hawaiʻi as a death  penalty  for those who broke kapu. The guilty party was forced to drink  the  juice of ʻākia, causing seizure and death. [1,4]  Botanist Otto  Degener (1945) mentions that criminals were executed by means of a  deadly drink prepared from roots and bark of ʻākia together with parts  of other plants. However, another reputable reference says that 'no  parts of ʻākia are poisonous to mammals,'  likely including humans. [2]  However, it is possible that not all species of Wikestroemia  are poisonous, judging by experiments where ʻākia has been shown to be  nontoxic. Handy and Handy (1972:239) distinguished two types of ʻākia: a  bitter ʻākia  (ʻākia ʻawa) and a ‘mild’ ʻākia  (ʻākia  manalo). The  bitter ʻākia  is described as a shrub that bears orange-red fruits, a  description that matches that of most Hawaiian Wikestroemia  species. Of this type they write that decoctions of the bark and roots  are deadly poisonous and were used for killing and suicide. The other  mild type of ʻākia, of which no description is given, is described as  not being poisonous but rather whose bark and leaves were used as a  narcotic. [6] Either way, it is probably best to  side with caution and avoid ingesting any parts of ʻākia until sound  information is available.",NA,"Apply a balanced slow release fertilizer with minor elements every 6 months.
